# survey
This is a survey using express, node, &amp; mysql (sequalize).

## Installation


## TODO:
*Secure the admin dashboard from guest users
*Prevent guest from recieving the same survey twice
*Add naviation button, so admin can easily navigate back to take surveys
*Give admin the option to view survey info, instead of always showing it
*Various CSS improvements (display data for admin better - build a grid or maybe even look into d3, make it not bland, etc)
*When a survey is created, add the admin to the 'author' attribute of the survey data (can be used to show only their survey data)
